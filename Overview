Hello.

The point of this Git repository is to improve upon our current system of implementing BYOX devices into our network.
We have begun by recreating our existing .bat scripts in powershell. after this is complete we intend to attach these scripts
to a GUI interface that is easy to use for users to create an almost autonomous solution.

At this stage we have done the follwoing:

The GUI has been created

The first script, Wifi ADD, has been paritally recreated in powershell.

The second script, Map Network Drives, has not been created

The third script, Map Network Printers, has not been created
